Caveats:
"1. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age-Adjusted Rates."
"2. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#2000 Standard Population."
"3. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the live births for the"
"given time period. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"4. Population figures in this table for 1979 and 1981-89 are intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population of the"
"United States. Note that the state and county population estimates for these years are not consistent with national estimates."
"The population figures in this table for 1980 and 1990 are modified age-race-sex (MARS) April 1 census counts. The population"
"figures for 1991-98 are bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population."
"5. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates."
