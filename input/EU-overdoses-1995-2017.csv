"(1) National definitions usually refer to acute deaths directly related to drug consumption (""overdoses"", ""poisonings"" or ""drug-induced""). Note that, in a few countries, the figures might include also a limited number of cases of deaths indirectly related to drug use (e.g. accidents with positive toxicology). Note in addition that in some countries, statistics published at national level may differ from those presented here, owing to differences of case definition used at national level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Comparisons between countries must be made with caution, because mortality rates and trends are influenced by factors such as practices of reporting, recording information and coding overdose cases that may vary across countries and time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) General notes about interpreting the data are shown first, followed by notes which are specific to data in the table (these latter notes are indicated within the table with an asterisk (*)).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) Austria: Since 2008, the official number of drug related deaths includes cases were no autopsy was performed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) Sweden: In 2016 Sweden updated data since 2001 in order to include T40.4 cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6) United Kingdom: (6) United Kingdom: The UK has made several changes for 2015 reporting for this definition:<br>1) The UK Focal Point has chosen to change reporting for England & Wales to report by the year deaths occurred rather than the year of registration.  This is to give internal consistency with figures from Scotland, as England & Wales experiences lengthy delays in registration of deaths while Scotland does not.  However, this means that the latest available reporting year is 2016, as this is the latest year for which it can be assumed that the large majority of deaths in England & Wales have now been registered. Figures for last reporting years will need to be revised for next reporting to take into account any very late registrations.<br>2) Deaths with an underlying cause of death of X44, X64 and Y14 alongside relevant T-codes have been incorporated into UK figures, to fully apply the EMCDDA definition for drug-related deaths extracted from General mortality registers (so called ""Selection B""). Due to historical coding practice in England & Wales, this has substantially increased the number of deaths counted under this definition currently and historically. Figures for Scotland have also been revised, although there are very few cases under this definition, while deaths for Northern Ireland with these codes have been reported previously.<br>3) Responsibility for calculation of England and Wales figures has moved from Office of national Statistics (ONS) to be calculated in-house by the UK Focal Point, via Public Health England and Public Health Wales.  This has led to the exclusion of non-residents of England and Wales for reporting for those countries.<br>4) United Kingdom: From 2013 onwards data refers to EMCDDA definition for General Mortality Register so called ""Selection B"" whereas before data based on the Drug Strategy Definition (DSD) were used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
